# Welcome to the RiseFX Coding Challenge

As part of the interview process for the full stack end developer position, we would like you to complete this coding challenge.

## Create an interactive table that displays data from a GraphQL endpoint and implement at least two of the following features:

- **Sorting by column** - Allow the user to sort the table data by a specific column in ascending or descending order.
- **Filtering by different fields** - Allow the user to filter the table by different fields, such as name or date.
- **Pagination** - Allow the user to navigate through the table using pagination.
- **Selecting which columns to display** - Allow the user to select which properties of the data to display in the table.
- **Reordering columns** - Allow the user to reorder the columns in the table.
- **Changing column widths** - Allow the user to change the width of the columns in the table.

While we we only ask that you attempt to implement two, additionally, we would like you to consider how you would approach implementing any features you did not include, as we may discuss this during the interview.

You are welcome to come up with and implement your own additional features if you would like to.

**We expect you to spend about 2 - 3 hours on this challenge.**
